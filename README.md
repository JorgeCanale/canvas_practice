# How to see the animations?
<br>
##  1 - what I'm doing here?
### just practicing some animation with canvas to improve my html, css and DOM manipulation with the final goal to make some basic website videogames 
## 2 - setting the extensions
### I truly recommend to hace the "Live Server" extension to se the website with the canvas animations so you can change things in the code as you want and just refresh the website as you want
###
## 3 - how to navegate through the files?
### for the moment i don't implement any type of "navegation" so you have to select de hmtl  file on the visual estudio code, pres the right click of the mouse and select the "open with live server" option
